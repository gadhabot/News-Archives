# NewsArchives
 
A project that logs news articles for everyone to see. Storing data since October 26, 2020. Get news by making an HTTP request. Index articles by [date](indexing/day.md), [month](indexing/month.md), [year](indexing/year.md), and [keyword](indexing/year.md). <br><br>

### What? Why?
Think about this: In ten years, you will be able to see what exactly was going on in the world today. For example, you could see what was on the news the day the coronavirus vaccine came out. Or maybe instead you want to search for when a certain topic was trending on the world scale, like the presidential election. The possibilities are endless. Information is added daily at 10:00 pm UTC from BBC News.

### Open Source
It's open source, meaning you can view the backend of the API or contribute. Whether you're [proposing a code change](contributing/code-changes.md), [reporting a bug](contributing/reporting-bugs.md), [making a suggestion](contributing/suggestions.md), requesting a modification to the documentation, or just curious to see the code, this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gadhagod/News-Archives) is what you're looking for.
